# High-Performance Parallel N-Body Simulation

Real-Time Gravitational Dynamics Simulation with Pygame UI, Python, PyCUDA, and MPI

üìå **Project Overview**

This project explores high-performance computing (HPC) techniques for simulating the gravitational interactions of multiple bodies in 2D/3D space.  
We implement and benchmark three approaches:

- **Serial Python Implementation**
    
- **MPI Parallelism (`mpi4py`)**
    
- **GPU Acceleration (PyCUDA)**
    

The simulation includes a **real-time UI using Pygame**, which runs on a **separate thread** to allow smooth visualization while computations (forces, integration, and updates) run concurrently in the main simulation thread.  
The study aims to analyse **speedup**, **scalability**, and **accuracy** across these methods for real-time simulation of planetary systems, star clusters, and particle dynamics.
